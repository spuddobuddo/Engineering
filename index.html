<h3><u>Week 2 (09/02/2022)</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>I learned about the different professions of engineering.</li>
<li>I did a safety quiz about callouts, how to handle most tools, and what to wear when in the lab.</li> 
<li>After, I designed my own laptop on TinkerCad and it turned out pretty good.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Week 3 (09/09/2022)</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>I designed a Rube Goldberg machine on TinkerCad.</li>
<li>I measured and designed an E on a sheet of paper. I measured and cut out my partner's E on a blank sheet of paper. I learned that it's hard to draw straight lines without graphed paper. This project was mainly a review of how to use a ruler and the importance of materials.</li> 
</ul>
