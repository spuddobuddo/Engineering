<td><h3>Week #1 | Date: 01/13/2023</h3></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>I learned about the insides of business engineering. Some key takeaways were to appeal to the customer and to basically be a manager for all designs and ideas
relating to the customers. UI and UX are the two sides that business engineers deal with, whether it be color grading or user information. </li>
<li>My group did a shark tank pitch. Our idea was to make a universal cap with a sleeve that kept your drink cold. One problem we faced was the pricing of our product.
Many people were unhappy because it was too high for them, which was a factor we didn't consider. Overall, it wasn't too bad though compared to our other competitors and
managed to get some support. </li> 
</ul>

<td><h3>Week #2 | Date: 01/20/2023</h3></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>I learned about chemical engineering and how it basically applies to anything, whether it be perfume or computers. Most if not all products rely on chemical engineering
in some form, which is why it's a great job. Some specific areas that are cool are nanotechnology, where you work with atoms at a nano-level where they are stronger and faster,
and oil refinery. After, we did a challenge of removing bromate, which consists of sunlight, chlorine, and water, from a lake. Our solution was to use shade balls, which was
the solution. Shade balls prevents most of the sunlight from hitting the lake, causing bromate to not be formed.</li>
<li>My partner and I attempted to create oobleck. We failed miserably, but we tried our best. We didn't stir it evenly enough, leading to one side being really soft and 
one side being really hard.</li> 
</ul>

<td><h3>Arduino Car Project</h3>
<h4>(Week #3 - Week #8)</h4></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Our project performed pretty well on the last week because as a group, we worked on it really hard with the time given. My groupmates and I all contributed to the project as much 
and as hard as we could, and we asked for help when we were stuck, which definitely led to our success. We didn't achieve what we originally set out for, mainly because we didn't have 
access to a third motor that would've allowed for the car to turn. We also didn't get the bluetooth to work because it only worked with Samsung, which we lacked most of the time. Our
design somwhat matched the CAD we made, but we had to shift a few things around since the 3D print came out slightly smaller. We also had to flip everything over to the back side of the
print since nothing would've fit due to the smaller size, but we improvised and made it work.</li>
<li>I learned more about programming and putting wires together with an arduino and how to properly connect it to a motor driver. I also relearned how to solder. I learned about good designs
and builds of arduino cars that allow it to drive properly and other minute stuff of building like weight distribution. </li> 
<li>All of my group's responsibilities were split pretty equally. However, one of our groupmates Will was sick during a lot of the project, which definitely slowed us down. Despite this,
Will still contributed a lot during his time with us. He figured out the wiring of the bluetooth and redid the wiring of the arduino correctly when we got stuck while he was here. Ryan
worked completely on the design, which took him a lot of time. He also always helped and tried his best to figure out the bluetooth connection between the phone and the car. Everyone
in the group was cooperative and almost always working, and we always bounced ideas off of each other.</li>
</ul>

  <td><h3>Week #9 | Date: 03/09/2023</h3></td>
  <td>
  <ul>
  <li>
    With my group, I created a gutter-boat. When were we designing, we decided to use balloons as propulsion, a flat surface to make it float, and a sail to help the
    balloon float. We created a raft with a sail on it, with a balloon on the back to propel it. We didn't know how to use rubber bands, which made us go with our decision
    for the balloons.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our boat did horribly. It didn't go as far as we hoped it would, and we didn't set any expectations. The boat went about 0.1 meters. As a group, we didn't fully
    understand the directions given to use and improvised the best we could. The boat itself was a tiny bit too big, so we cut it down. However, that wasn't the only
    issue. The sail was too big and weighing the boat down, and the balloon failed to propel the boat at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    For our boat, I would've taped the balloon and then poked holes in it to allow the balloon to slowly let out air instead of all at once. I would've also obviously
    downsized the boat as that was the major flaw. If we were given more time, I would've researched gutter boats more.
  </li> 
  </ul>
