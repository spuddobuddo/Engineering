<ul>
<li>I learned about the insides of business engineering. Some key takeaways were to appeal to the customer and to basically be a manager for all designs and ideas
relating to the customers. UI and UX are the two sides that business engineers deal with, whether it be color grading or user information. </li>
<li>My group did a shark tank pitch. Our idea was to make a universal cap with a sleeve that kept your drink cold. One problem we faced was the pricing of our product.
Many people were unhappy because it was too high for them, which was a factor we didn't consider. Overall, it wasn't too bad though compared to our other competitors and
managed to get some support. </li>
