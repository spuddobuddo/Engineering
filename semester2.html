<td><h3>Week #1 | Date: 01/13/2023</h3></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>I learned about the insides of business engineering. Some key takeaways were to appeal to the customer and to basically be a manager for all designs and ideas
relating to the customers. UI and UX are the two sides that business engineers deal with, whether it be color grading or user information. </li>
<li>My group did a shark tank pitch. Our idea was to make a universal cap with a sleeve that kept your drink cold. One problem we faced was the pricing of our product.
Many people were unhappy because it was too high for them, which was a factor we didn't consider. Overall, it wasn't too bad though compared to our other competitors and
managed to get some support. </li> 
</ul>

<td><h3>Week #2 | Date: 01/20/2023</h3></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>I learned about chemical engineering and how it basically applies to anything, whether it be perfume or computers. Most if not all products rely on chemical engineering
in some form, which is why it's a great job. Some specific areas that are cool are nanotechnology, where you work with atoms at a nano-level where they are stronger and faster,
and oil refinery. After, we did a challenge of removing bromate, which consists of sunlight, chlorine, and water, from a lake. Our solution was to use shade balls, which was
the solution. Shade balls prevents most of the sunlight from hitting the lake, causing bromate to not be formed.</li>
<li>My partner and I attempted to create oobleck. We failed miserably, but we tried our best. We didn't stir it evenly enough, leading to one side being really soft and 
one side being really hard.</li> 
</ul>
